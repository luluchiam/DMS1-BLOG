While brainstorming ideas for the concept of "dream," I explored various symbolic elements to capture the essence of this elusive and surreal state. I considered images like the moon and stars to evoke the night sky, and symbols such as clouds and magic balls to represent the ethereal and mysterious nature of dreams. I also thought about incorporating objects like books and hourglasses to reflect the storytelling and fluid perception of time within dreams. This process involved blending both familiar and imaginative symbols to create a comprehensive representation of how dreams weave together aspects of our subconscious and imagination.
