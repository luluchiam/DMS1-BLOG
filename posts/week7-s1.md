This was a fun exercise which helped me understand how Unity works and how cool it is, it was also a good first exercise to introduce us to Unity.

## Homework: Digital Environment Sketch

A rough sketch of my environment, I want to create two houses which represents a change from being lonely and feeling lost to feeling a new positive energy and personal growth.

 The dull house represents a time in my life before I transitioned into adulthood, a period when I often felt like I didnâ€™t fit in. Just like the house stood in silence, I often felt isolated, unable to connect with those around me, waiting for a transformation that would bring colour and meaning into my life.

The colourful house represents the transformation I experienced after embracing a new shift of positive energy in my life. The vibrant colours reflect how I began to feel more included and connected, no longer isolated like before and symbolises my personal growth.
