I asked my friend Venus to playtest my 3D environment, I felt like the results were pretty positive as she managed to go in the portal pretty quickly. She told me that the portal was one of the first things she noticed which shows a good sign since I want people to go insdie the portal. When playing she showed me that she was pretty confused at what was going on but after she went into the portal she seemed to understand that it was about change as she asked me "Is this about changing from a ugly and dark house to a colourful one?" She doesn't really play any games so she wasn't super interested in the game so she stopped playing as soon as she entered the portal to go into the new scene. Overall, she did give me feedback which was that it was a simple and straightfoward game.
