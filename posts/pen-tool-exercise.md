The pen tool exercise was instrumental in helping me practise and become more familiar with its capabilities. By working through various tasks, I gained hands-on experience in creating precise paths and shapes, which is crucial for detailed graphic design work. The exercise allowed me to experiment with different techniques, understand the toolâ€™s nuances, and refine my skills in creating smooth curves and accurate lines. As a result, I now feel more confident in using the pen tool effectively, which enhances my overall proficiency in digital design projects.
