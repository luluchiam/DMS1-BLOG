## An Exploding Coffee
![test](IMG_7490.jpg)

We immediately went to one of the coffee shops in campus because to our understanding, there was nothing else or no other place that made sense.

## A basement-dwelling black box, bigger than you might think

This one was really confusing and we didn't manage to find a black box but we saw this study space that looked like a big black box. 

## A book containing digital media wisdom, found amongst many

This was quite challenging for us as we were all new to campus and we didn't know our way around the library but we tried our best to find a book that was somewhat related to digital media.

## A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo

We actually had to get a librarian's help to find this because we didn't understand this task at all.

## The disembodied hands of a great ape

We actually saw another group from our class take a picture here and we found that it made the most sense to the "hands of a great ape"

## A study space fit for a Sith Lord

One of our group members actually knew this place so she led us directly to this study space which was pretty cool.

## A door for the condemned

Another group actually helped us with this one because we didn't have any clue on what this meant.

## A golden globe atop of tower of eights

This one was really funny because we were looking everywhere for a golden globe but never found it and we saw this golden oval shaped thingy on top so we decided to just go with it.

## A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land

When we saw "dispensing beverages" we immediately thought of the vending machine.

## A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor

We were very confused with this and we had to rush back to class so we found this place that had roots.
