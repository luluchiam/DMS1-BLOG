## An Exploding Coffee
![test](IMG_7490.jpg)

We immediately went to one of the coffee shops in campus because to our understanding, there was nothing else or no other place that made sense.

## A basement-dwelling black box, bigger than you might think

This one was really confusing and we didn't manage to find a black box but we saw this study space that looked like a big black box.Â 

## A book containing digital media wisdom, found amongst manyÂ 
![image](pic3.jpg)
This was quite challenging for us as we were all new to campus and we didn't know our way around the library but we tried our best to find a book that was somewhat related to digital media.

## A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo
![image](pic4.jpg)
We actually had to get a librarian's help to find this because we didn't understand this task at all.

## The disembodied hands of a great ape
![image](pic5.jpg)
We actually saw another group from our class take a picture here and we found that it made the most sense to the "hands of a great ape"

## A study space fit for a Sith LordÂ

One of our group members actually knew this place so she led us directly to this study space which was pretty cool.

## A door for the condemnedÂ 
![image](pic7.jpg)
Another group actually helped us with this one because we didn't have any clue on what this meant.

## A golden globe atop of tower of eights
![image](pic8.jpg)
This one was really funny because we were looking everywhere for a golden globe but never found it and we saw this golden oval shaped thingy on top so we decided to just go with it.

## A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land
![image](pic9.jpg)
When we saw "dispensing beverages" we immediately thought of the vending machine.

## A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor
![image](pic10.jpg)
We were very confused with this and we had to rush back to class so we found this place that had roots.

... or block, like this:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$
