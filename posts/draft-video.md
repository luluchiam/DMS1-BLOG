In this self-portrait video, I will be taking videos that I have from my camera roll to make it into a memory type montage. I had just arrived to Australia so I barely have any videos here and I felt like taking videos of the city can't truly express who I am, I want my self-portrait video to be a video where when people watch, they'll think "oh this is what she's like"
